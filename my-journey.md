My journey into philanthropy education began not in a classroom, but in the aftermath of a disaster. In May 2008, the devastating Sichuan earthquake struck. At the time, I was in my early thirties, working a stable job at an American company. Like many in China, it was the first time I had ever volunteered. That experience, witnessing both the immense suffering and the profound resilience of people, changed the trajectory of my life. It was a turning point.

A year later, I left the corporate world and enrolled in business school at Boston University, choosing to specialize in a field that was still nascent in China: Public and Nonprofit Management. It was there that I met my mentor, the late Peter Karoff, a pioneer who founded the field of philanthropic advising in the U.S.

Peter taught me two things that would become the bedrock of my life's work. First, that philanthropy is not just about giving money; it is a profound expression of one's personal values. The work must start from within, by asking "Who am I and what do I care about?". Second, he taught me that philanthropy must be strategic. Good intentions are not enough; we must pursue real, measurable impact.

In the following years, I had the privilege of acting as a bridge, helping Chinese foundations on their study tours in Boston. I saw their passion and their eagerness to learn, but I also saw their frustration when they returned home, unable to apply what they had learned in a completely different ecosystem. It became clear to me that something fundamental was missing at the grassroots level.

A combination of factors, including a desire to be closer to my aging parents, brought me back to China. I knew my work was here. And I knew it had to start with young people.

Many people see our work as being full of uncertainty, but to me, it is a constant source of energy. This is because it aligns perfectly with my core personal values: Freedom, Authenticity, Growth, Inspiration, and Creation. This work allows me the freedom to explore, demands that I be authentic with myself and our students, pushes me to grow constantly, inspires me through the growth of others, and empowers me to create new models where none existed before. It is this alignment that fuels my journey.

This is the path I am on. It has been a long and winding one, and at times, it feels lonely. I am eager to meet fellow travelers on this path, to share stories from our different landscapes, and to find strength and inspiration in our shared commitment to empowering the next generation.
