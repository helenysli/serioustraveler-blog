title: "My Journey: How I Got Here"
---

My journey into philanthropy education began not in a classroom, but in the aftermath of a disaster. In May 2008, the devastating Sichuan earthquake struck. At the time, I was in my early thirties, working a stable job at an American company. Like many in China, it was the first time I had ever volunteered. That experience, witnessing both the immense suffering and the profound resilience of people, changed the trajectory of my life. It was a turning point.

A year later, I left the corporate world and enrolled in business school at Boston University, choosing to specialize in a field that was still nascent in China: Public and Nonprofit Management. It was then when I met my mentor, the late Peter Karoff, a pioneer who founded the field of philanthropic advising in the U.S.

Peter taught me two things that would become the bedrock of my life's work. First, that philanthropy is not just about giving money; it is a profound expression of one's personal values. The work must start from within, by asking, "Who am I and what are my values?". Second, he taught me that philanthropy must be strategic. Good intentions are not enough; we must pursue real, measurable impact.

In the following years, I had the privilege of acting as a bridge, helping Chinese foundations on their study tours in Boston. I saw their passion and their eagerness to learn, but I also saw their frustration when they returned home, unable to apply what they had learned in a completely different ecosystem. It became clear that something fundamental was missing at the grassroots level.

Returning to China meant stepping onto this new frontier. It was a landscape where the well-established models from the U.S. couldn't simply be transplanted. The work wasn't about implementing known solutions, but about exploring, listening, and co-creating new paths from the ground up. I knew my work was here. And I knew it had to start with young people.

This journey is a constant source of energy because it aligns perfectly with my core values: Freedom, Authenticity, Growth, Inspiration, and Creation. This work allows me the freedom to explore, demands that I be authentic with my students, pushes me to grow constantly, and empowers me to create new models where none existed before.

This is the path I am onâ€”that of a serious traveler on the frontier. It has been a long and winding one, and at times, it can be lonely. That is why I am so eager to meet fellow travelers, to share stories from our different landscapes, and to find strength and inspiration in our shared commitment to empowering the next generation.  

The best place to continue this conversation is on LinkedIn. I find it helps filter out the noise of spam. I am happy to share my email address via a direct message there.
