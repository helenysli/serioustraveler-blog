description: "I'm a youth philanthropy educator from China, sharing my notes on youth purpose. As I visit the U.S., I invite fellow educators to connect and explore our shared impact."
---

**Hello, and welcome.** 

My name is Helen Li, founder of Dominos Philanthropy Academy, a social enterprise in Shanghai using philanthropy as a vehicle for youth development. 

I believe we are at a rare historical juncture in China. We have the opportunity to help shape a generation’s relationship with philanthropy and to unlock community service as a powerful, yet still under-recognized, path for growth. It is this sense of possibility that brings me to the United States to listen and to learn.

This website is my practitioner’s notebook, filled with the real, often messy, process of trying to build something meaningful from the ground up. To begin the conversation, I've shared three core notes:

* The Winding Path: A story of our journey through trial, error, and evolution.
* A Long-Distance Run: An attempt to map the unique landscape of philanthropy education in China.
* Making Purpose Visible: A deep dive into the framework we use to design and witness growth.

I am visiting the States from October 1st to 12th and hope to connect with fellow travelers on this path—practitioners, researchers, and educators who are also exploring how to cultivate purpose in youth. I am here to learn from your experiences, share lessons from our winding path in China, and explore our shared questions.

I hope these notes offer a glimpse into our world. More than just starting a conversation, I hope we can connect. By sharing our wisdom and experiences across borders, I believe we can better support the young people we serve and, in doing so, help shape a more thoughtful and compassionate world.

In dialogue,

Helen Li
