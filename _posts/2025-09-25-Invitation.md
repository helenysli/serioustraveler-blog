**Hello, and welcome.** 

My name is Helen Li. I am an educator from China, working on what I believe is a new frontier: helping a generation shape its relationship with philanthropy. It is this sense of possibility that brings me to the United States to listen and learn.

What excites me most is the sense that we are at a rare historical juncture in China. We have the opportunity to help shape a generation’s relationship with philanthropy, and to unlock community service as a powerful, yet still under-recognized, path for youth development. It is this sense of possibility that brings me to the United States to listen and to learn.

This website is a collection of my field notes from that journey. It is not a showcase of perfect models, but a practitioner’s notebook, filled with the real, often messy, process of trying to build something meaningful from the ground up.

To begin the conversation, I've shared three core notes from my notebook:

\* **The Winding Path:** A story of our journey through trial, error, and evolution.

\* **A Long-Distance Run:** An attempt to map the unique landscape of philanthropy education in China.

\* **Making Purpose Visible:** A deep dive into the framework we use to design and witness growth.

During my visit, I hope to connect with fellow travelers on this path—practitioners, researchers, and educators who are also exploring how to cultivate purpose in youth. 

I hope to learn from experts who are cultivating purpose in youth, visit schools with strong service-learning practices, and exchange ideas with organizations that are building the infrastructure for philanthropy education.

I am here to learn from your experiences, share lessons from our winding path in China, and explore our shared questions.

I hope these notes offer a glimpse into our world. More than anything, I hope they can be the start of a real conversation.

In dialogue,

Helen Li
