**Hello, and welcome.** 

My name is Helen Li. I am the founder of Dominos Philanthropy Academy, a social enterprise based in Shanghai, using philanthropy as a vehicle to help youth grow.  Our mission is to make service accessible and growth visible.  

What excites me most is the sense that we are at a rare historical juncture in China in terms of philanthropy education. There is this rare  opportunity to help shape a generation’s relationship with philanthropy, and to unlock community service as a powerful, yet still under-recognized, path for youth development. It is this sense of possibility that brings me to the United States to listen and to learn.

I am traveling in the States between October 1st and 12th.  I'd love to connect with fellow travelers in the filed of youth philanthropy education. 

This website is a collection of my field notes from that journey. It is not a showcase of perfect models, but a practitioner’s notebook, filled with the real, often messy, process of trying to build something meaningful from the ground up.

To begin the conversation, I've shared three core notes from my notebook:

\* **The Winding Path:** A story of our journey through trial, error, and evolution.

\* **A Long-Distance Run:** An attempt to map the unique landscape of philanthropy education in China.

\* **Making Purpose Visible:** A deep dive into the framework we use to design and witness growth.

During my visit, I hope to connect with fellow travelers on this path—practitioners, researchers, and educators who are also exploring how to cultivate purpose in youth. 

I hope to learn from experts who are cultivating purpose in youth, visit schools with strong service-learning practices, and exchange ideas with organizations that are building the infrastructure for philanthropy education.

I am here to learn from your experiences, share lessons from our winding path in China, and explore our shared questions.

I hope these notes offer a glimpse into our world. More than anything, I hope they can be the start of a real conversation.

In dialogue,

Helen Li
