**Hello, and welcome.**  My name is Helen Li, and I am an educator from China, working on what often feels like a new frontier: philanthropy education for young people.

<!--more-->

What excites me most is the sense that we are at a rare historical juncture in China. We have the opportunity to help shape a generation’s relationship with philanthropy, and to unlock community service as a powerful, yet still under-recognized, path for youth development. It is this sense of possibility that brings me to the United States to listen and to learn.

This website is a collection of my field notes from that journey. It is not a showcase of perfect models, but a practitioner’s notebook, filled with the real, often messy, process of trying to build something meaningful from the ground up.

To begin the conversation, I've shared three core notes from my notebook:

\* **The Winding Path:** A story of our journey through trial, error, and evolution.

\* **A Long-Distance Run:** An attempt to map the unique landscape of philanthropy education in China.

\* **Making Purpose Visible:** A deep dive into the framework we use to design and witness growth.

During my visit, I am especially eager to connect with fellow practitioners and researchers. I hope to learn from experts who are cultivating purpose in youth, visit schools with strong service-learning practices, and exchange ideas with organizations that are building the infrastructure for philanthropy education.

I hope these notes offer a glimpse into our world. More than anything, I hope they can be the start of a real conversation.

In dialogue,

Helen Li
